# Week 3 - Password Generator
 
<br>This is a character generator that allows the user to input a string of characters with a length between 8 and 128. The program provides the user with four options to choose from: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.</br>

<br>When the user selects the types of characters they want, the generator produces a string with at least one character from each selected category. The order of the characters is randomized.</br>

## Usage

To use the character generator, follow these steps:

<br>1. Enter a length for the string of characters (between 8 and 128).</br>
<br>2. Select the types of characters you want to include (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters).</br>
<br>3. Press the "Generate" button to create a new string of characters.</br>

<br>The program will produce a new string of characters each time the "Generate" button is pressed.</br>
